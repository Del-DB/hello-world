# hello-world

Hi, I'm Del!

I'm new to the programming world and have a keen interest in learning more about how it all works.
I've started with the Harvard CS50 course which requires the use of GitHub in the learning process.
As such, I'm excited to finish this tutorial and move to the next step of my journey!
